# Recipe Sharing Platform

A MERN stack plaform which allows users to learn and share healthy cuisines from diverse ethnic backgrounds.

# Initial Idea

I am a food lover! I love trying and cooking all kinds of yummy food. During our school breaks, Sonu and I struggled with ideas for making our ethnic food accessible to the student community on campus. We thought, what if we could build a platform for students to engage, learn, and share their culture, family traditions, and love through the medium of food? ðŸ¥— ðŸ¥ª
